								<p>I am a passionate and results-driven Data Scientist with a focus on leveraging AI technologies to solve complex problems. With a strong background in Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, I have successfully completed various projects and certifications in the field.
								</p>
								<p>One of my notable projects was "Text To Image," where I utilized DALLÂ·E, a generative AI model from OpenAI, to develop a user interface using Streamlit. This application takes a text prompt as input and generates corresponding images using the model. To enhance the user experience, I uploaded the application to the Streamlit Community Cloud.

									Another remarkable project I worked on was "Langchain combined with OpenAI." In this project, I developed a system that converts PDF files into text using OpenAI and Langchain as a wrapper. The extracted text is then divided into chunks, which are embedded using OpenAI Embedding and stored in a knowledge base. The system utilizes FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to search for the best-ranked result when users prompt questions related to the PDF.
									
									I also have experience in building voice assistants using OpenAI. With the help of a simple Python library, I developed a voice assistant that converts user speech into text and utilizes ChatGPT LLM to provide answers to their questions. Additionally, this voice assistant incorporates sentiment analysis, reacting to the user's emotions using Sentiment Intensity Analyzer. It also includes interactive features like playing games, streaming songs from YouTube, and sending messages through WhatsApp.
									
									Throughout my academic journey, I pursued a Master's degree in Data Science from Guvi/IIT Madras after completing my B.E in Mechatronics from Kongu Engineering College. These educational experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and problem-solving.
									
									I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of Data Science. With a passion for innovation and a drive to make a positive impact, I am eager to contribute to exciting projects and collaborate with talented professionals.
